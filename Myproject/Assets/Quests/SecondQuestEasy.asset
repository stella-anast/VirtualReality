  - As I said before, I need something else which the next riddle reveals.
  - Two sharp, two stacked, for slicing and warmth sacked.
  - Well, will you do it?
  acceptOption: Okay, I'll bring you 2 knives and 2 piles of wood.
  acceptAnswer: Good for you.
  declineOption: Unfortunately I can't help you.
  declineAnswer: If you believe you can make it without me, you are free to leave.
  comebackAfterDecline: Did you change your mind?
  comebackInProgress: These are not enough.
  comebackCompleted: Oh great! Thank you. Here is your reward.
  finalWords: I don't have the key, but I know someone who can help you. As you traverse
    the sacred site, a bridge you'll find in sight, ere you cross, on it someone
    you'll meet.
