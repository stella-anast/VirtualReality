  initialDialog:
  - As I said, I need some last things.
  - 'Since you''ve made it this far, I''ll ask without a riddle. '
  - I need 3 wooden sticks, 4 piles of wood and a knife.
  - Will you bring them to me?
  acceptOption: Sure!
  acceptAnswer: Great! If you succeed, then I will reveal the next element to you.
  declineOption: Sorry, I can't.
  declineAnswer: Then I'm sorry for whatever is going to happen in your village...if
    you change your mind you know where you can find me.
  comebackAfterDecline: Did you change your mind?
  comebackInProgress: These are not enough. I will need more.
  comebackCompleted: These are great! Thank you!
  finalWords: I don't have what you searching for but...In the depths of the forest,
    where shadows dance,there beneath the earth, where secrets sigh and prance. Beyond
    mortal sight's extending lance, a crucial clue lies, embraced by the shadows.
