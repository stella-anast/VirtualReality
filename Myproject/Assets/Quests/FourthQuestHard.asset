  initialDialog:
  - You may have succeeded so far, but you won't get what you want so easily.
  - If you possess these materials, you can achieve warmth, but you must also bring
    something more valuable to benefit.
  - Will you bring them to me?
  acceptOption: Sure, I'll bring rocks, wooden sticks and some money.
  acceptAnswer: 'Great! '
  declineOption: I don't think so.
  declineAnswer: You are making a mistake! I am certain you will change your mind.
  comebackAfterDecline: Ha! I knew it. Are you ready for your quest?
  comebackInProgress: Keep going! I need more.
  comebackCompleted: Nice! You found everything.
  finalWords: With a base of stone and a peak of steel, motionless in peace, yet
    aids the wheel. We stride across, forging our path, uniting the distance, bridging
    the chasm vast. At this place, you must give these items, and you will find what
    you seek.
